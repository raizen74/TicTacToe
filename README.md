# Tic Tac Toe game

Implemented in Python. It is a simple game so I have approached the project with 4 functions to define the entire logic of the game:
- display_board: displays the board
- check_victory: checks if user has reached the goal condition
- enter_move: forces the user to enter a valid input and returns it
- play: defines all the game logic
